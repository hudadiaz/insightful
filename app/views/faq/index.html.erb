          <h5>What is Insightful?</h5>
          <p>Insightful is a web application which purpose of existent is too help researchers and anyone with raw data to visualize their data with beautiful charts and graphs.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-items">
          <h5>How do I use Insightful?</h5>
          <p>You need an account to use Insightful. You can create an account <%= link_to 'here', edit_user_registration_path %>. Then, upload your data to insightful whether by uploading a file or manually entering them in the text area provided in the new data <%= link_to 'form', new_datum_path %>. Insightful only accepts Comma Separated Values (<code>CSV</code>). If your data is not in <code>CSV</code> format, you need to convert them first. You can start visualizing your data using four visualizations options provided which are sankey, sunburst, stacked bar and normalize stacked bar.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-items">
          <h5>Which visualization should I use?</h5>
          <p>Depending on the nature of your data, you might want to experiment which visualization option is the best.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-items">
          <h5>Help, I cannot save my data!</h5>
          <p>Insightful only accepts properly formatted <code>CSV</code> files and texts. Make sure your data is a valid <code>CSV</code>.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-items">
          <h5>I am sure my data is in <code>CSV</code>. What happens?</h5>
          <p>For the moment, Insightful can only process raw data (1 record per row).</p>

          <h5>What is sankey?</h5>
          <p>Sankey diagrams are a specific type of flow diagram, in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity. Sankey diagrams are typically used to visualize energy or material or cost transfers between processes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram">Wikipedia</a></p>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-items">
          <h5>How to draw a sankey diagram?</h5>
          <p>In the draw sankey page, there are 2 selects input. The first select input is where you select at most 4 columns that you want to see the relationship. Order of selection will determine the order of the sankey layers. The second select is used to determine how you want to measure the relationships. By default, the algorithm will count records. Be careful when drawing sankey with huge amount of unique values.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-items">
          <h5>What is sunburst?</h5>
          <p>A ring chart, also known as a sunburst chart or a multilevel pie chart, is used to visualize hierarchical data, depicted by concentric circles. The circle in the center represents the root node, with the hierarchy moving outward from the center. A segment of the inner circle bears a hierarchical relationship to those segments of the outer circle which lie within the angular sweep of the parent segment. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart">Wikipedia</a></p>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-items">
          <h5>How to draw a sunburst?</h5>
          <p>In the draw sunburst diagram, there are 2 selects inputs. The first input is where you select what column you want to draw on the sunburst. The order of selection determine the position of the column's values in the sunburst. There is no limit to how many layers you want to draw. The second select input is used to determine the size of arc of each values. By default, the algorithm will count the records. Arcs smaller than 0.29 degrees are hidden. Be careful when adding layer with huge amount of unique values.</p>

          <h5>What is stacked bars?</h5>
          <p>Stacked bar graphs present the information in the same sequence on each bar. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_chart">Wikipedia</a></p>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-items">
          <h5>What is normalize stacked bars?</h5>
          <p>Stacked bar graphs present the information in the same sequence on each bar normalized to 100%. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_chart">Wikipedia</a></p>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-items">
          <h5>How to draw stacked bars?</h5>
          <p>In the draw stacked bar and normalized stacked bar, there are 3 selects inputs. The first select determines the x-axis, the second select determines the grouping and the last determines values measured. The x-axis is limited to the highest 80 items. It is advised that the number of unique values of the second argument to be not more than 9.</p>

        <li class="faq-items">
          <h5>How to draw normal bar chart?</h5>
          <p>Stacked bars can draw usual bar chart. To do this, simply select the same column for the first 2 select inputs.</p>
